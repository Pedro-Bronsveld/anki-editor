## [1.0.1] - 2023-04-29

Small Javascript type checking level fix and readme updates.

- Changed the default type checking level of embedded Javascript in card templates to be similar to regular Javascript files opened in VSCode.
  Before, this was set to check Javascript as if it were Typescript. Which is not necessary in card templates.
- Added a setting to change Javascript type checking level back to strict, or turn it off completely.
- Updated links to extension in readme.

## [1.0.0] - 2023-04-22
